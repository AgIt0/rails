Hi and welcome to the first ever Ruby on Rails [HackBulgaria] class. I hope you
are as excited as we are!

The first week we're gonna refresh our Ruby skills a bit. Here is a list of
online materials we love:

## The PickAxe

A great book to get you started. You can [read][PickAxe] it online for free!

## Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby

If you are feeling a bit more adventurous, this is an interesting take on the
first steps in Ruby.

You can [read][why] it online. Soundtrack included.

## Core Ruby

You can visit the website of our previous class, which was Ruby exclusive. You
can find the [Core Ruby] website [here][Core Ruby].

## FMI

The parallel Ruby course in the Sofia University. If you have the time, please,
do yourself a favor and visit their lectures Monday and Wednesday. The best
Ruby lectures by far and away.

Visit their [website][fmi] for more information.

Keep up with this [site] as we'll be posting all the materials [here][site]. May all
the railties be with you!
